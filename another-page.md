# [](#header-1)Authors Bio

As a group of two, both with experience in working with Git and in particular GitHub, we opted for using it as control version system, taking advantage of the features offered by Git, namely branching and releasing. Unfortunately due to the restriction imposed by the fact that we only had one development kit, we did not worked concurrently on the project. Rather, we met and worked on the initial sketch together, to then assign different portions of the project to each member. Finally we met again for a revision and final check-up

>Born in Colombia in 1993, I started my journey in electronic engineering at the  University of Antioquia in 2010. After 5 years of studies I moved to Italy to pursuit a master degree in Embedded Systems at Politecnico di Torino. My areas of interest encomprise the development of specific purpose hardware in VHDL/Verilog, the programming of microcontolled based devices on C/C++ and the application of those in Machine Learning projects.
